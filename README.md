Steps to run the project

Github

Download the files from github and transfer them over to eclipse.

Open the command prompt and type in the following commands:
cd C:\Users\Jomziii\workspace\oop2016\bin
java gmit.ie.sw.EchoServer
java gmit.ie.sw.EchoServer 7777 C:\Users\Jomziii\workspace\Servers
(The 3r command is the file I used to download)

Once you have enter these 3 commands a message should appear. “Waiting for connection….”
(This means the server is waiting for a connection from the client.)

Eclipse

Type 1 into the console to connect to the server. (If you look at the CMD you should get a connection.)
Type 2 to print the file listing.
Type 3 downloads the file and presents you will and message asking which file you would like to download, so you will have to enter a path of the file you would like to download.
